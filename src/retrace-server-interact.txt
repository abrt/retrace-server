retrace-server-interact(1)
==========================

NAME
----
retrace-server-interact - use Retrace server's chroot
for interactive debugging.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'retrace-server-interact' [-h] [--priv] task_id action

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The tool makes Retrace server\'s chroot available for interactive
debugging. It enables user to jump into the chroot and execute
the correct tool (gdb/crash), automatically loading all
relevant files.

ACTIONS
-------
shell::
   Jump to a shell. Not available if mock chroot is not used. This is
   the case of vmcores from the same architecture as host system.

gdb::
   Run GDB, load executable and coredump and jump to prompt. Only available
   for binary crashes (coredumps).

crash::
   Run Crash, load vmcore and vmlinux and jump to prompt. Only available
   for kernel crashes (vmcores).

printdir::
   Print the directory of the task.

delete::
   Delete the task.  Use with caution (there is no undo).

set-success::
   Force task status to 'success'.  This may be useful if a task has been
   marked as "failed" by retrace-server but a user has other knowledge it
   is still useful.  This will avoid a possible early deletion of the task
   by retrace-server-cleanup which uses the DeleteFailedTaskAfter 
   configuration setting.

set-fail::
   Force task status to 'fail'.  This may be useful if a task has been
   marked as "success" by retrace-server but a user has other knowledge it
   is not useful.  This will allow a possible early deletion of the task
   by retrace-server-cleanup which uses DeleteFailedTaskAfter 
   configuration setting.


OPTIONS
-------
-h::
   Display help and exit.

--priv::
   Use the chroot as privileged user.
